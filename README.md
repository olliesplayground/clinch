# Clinch

Clinch is a lightweight, _no singing no dancing_ command line argument parser that acts as a 
wrapper to the `getopt` function native to PHP.

It provides a simple and friendly API that makes working with command line 
arguments a lot more pleasant.

### Usage

Clinch is installed via Composer by running the following

```
composer require olliesplayground/clinch
```
